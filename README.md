# Cloud-Deployment-of-Deep-Learning-Networks

Deploying a
model is a fundamental step in the machine learning model workflow. This
article will focus on deploying machine learning models where researchers can
begin to take full advantage of the predictive and intelligent models they
build and develop businesses based on the results, thereby transforming
themselves into AI-driven practices. This project creates an inference
operation and a deploy operation to deploy the model as a web service. The
inference is when a deployed model is used for prediction, usually to produce
resulting data. In inference, the research member will specify the dependencies
required by the service model. The deployment action specifies details about serving
the encapsulated model on the cloud computing target.
