# Cloud Deployment of Deep Learning Networks



**Project Title:** Cloud Deployment of Pre-trained Model(Grayscale Images AI coloring)

**Overview:** This project creates an inference operation and a deploy operation to deploy the model as a web service. The inference is when a deployed model is used for prediction, usually to produce resulting data. In inference, the research member will specify the dependencies required by the service model. The deployment action specifies details about serving the encapsulated model on the cloud computing target.

**Project Motivation:** After all the sweat invested in developing models with high predictive accuracy, companies are seen suffering from "model debt" with models that are not deployed or under-deployed. Often, what's missing is a "MLOps" strategy that combines machine learning development and IT best practices.

**Objectives:** This article will focus on deploying machine learning models where researchers can begin to take full advantage of the predictive and intelligent models they build and develop businesses based on the results, thereby transforming themselves into AI-driven practices.Set specific and measurable project goals.
